History:

19 Nov 2002: A small bug in HLINOP which allowed the wavelength to go negative if the REFLECT switch was turned on was fixed. Thanks to Kjell Eriksson for reporting it.

4 Jun 2003: I fixed the example files so they actually work;-), the old line file referenced the wrong model (one that is on my machine but not the tarred one!). I also have added compiler options for Intel's Fortran compiler under Linux to the makefile.

26 Aug 2003: Two minor bugs fixed which meant the resonance and Stark broadening in the Lyman alpha red wing was incorrect (bugs meant they were not computed at all).

27 April 2005: Small bug in HLINPROF, meant that log(0) occurred if using the self-broadening grids and interrogating a wavelength beyond the range of the profile grids. Now fixed thanks to Ulrike Heiter.

9 Jul 2008: SYNTH code updated so that it warns, rather than crashes, if one tries to feed it a spherical model. Thanks to Nik.

2 Mar 2011: Small bug for case where XHOLT4000 goes to zero fixed. Thanks to Kjell.

2 Mar 2011: hbop code added.

11 July 2023: Bug fixed in LOGINT routine in HBOP.f.  Thanks to Richard Hoppe. 
12 July 2023: Small improvement to LOGINT - log-linear interpolation performs better than log-log.

17 Dec 2025:  Added hbop_auto.f, and some small changes to hbop.f.  (Note these changes were actually made a year earlier, took some time to post to github;)).
